1. continous improvement of generated code ( e.g. more comments, ut.. etc.)
2. more window actions
3. use LLM to check if cloud product update( via api/documents/wiki) compatible with customizing code

Obtain the update content of the cloud product from update logs or API documentation.
Use a Language Model (LLM) to understand the semantics of the updates.
Translate the LLM's understanding into the specific impact on your custom code.
Use these impacts to check the compatibility of your custom code with the cloud product updates.
Modify your code if any incompatibilities are found to adapt to the new version of the cloud product.
